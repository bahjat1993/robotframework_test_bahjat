For scenario 1 i would recommend using python (anything above 3.7) and selenium.

I would start by numbering the requirements on scenario 1. 

Given that I am using a Google Chrome browser [SRS 1]
And I have opened the Google map by starting from the Google search page [SRS 2]
and I have gone to a location on the map after entering a given postcode – UB8 3PH - in the search box [SRS 3]
Then I want to be able to get the distance and the time it will take to travel to “S Loop Rd” by placing a marker on S Loop Rd and another position on the map. [SRS 4]


----------------------------------
For scenario 2 i would recommend using python (anything above 3.7) and selenium. The test plan for this is located in the excel sheet test_plan.ods on sheet name Scenario 2
I would start by numbering the requirements in scenario 2. 

Given an end user has started capturing content using a capturing device with a camera, an internet connection, and a browser with which to log into a secure HTTP/HTTPS website [SRS1]
And they can send content from the capturing device to a live encodeR [SRS 2]
And the encoder can transmit the content to the video hosting platform	[SRS 3]
Then the video hosting platform should be able to use HLS to transmit the content to an HTML5 video player which other end users can use to view the content being captured. [SRS 4]
