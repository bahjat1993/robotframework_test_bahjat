To run the tests:

1) Ensure you have python installed (python-3.7.4.exe, is located in this directory)
2) Run the setup.bat file, this will install all the neccessary plugins you need
3) run the "run_me.bat" file to run the tests

How i would have improved this project if given more time:
- I've tried my best not to have any "magic statements/numbers" but if given more time i would store all the CSS locators in a file which would be called up.
- I would change all the test cases that are Tagged as Manual and automate them using a few tools (selenium and pyautogui)
- I would have shown off my integration skills with jenkins and completely integrated the system to raise and close bugs on github and jira
- I would have implemented a screen shot system where every new webpage would have it's screen shot taken. I would have used humans to originally verify the image then used CV2 to verify that the image was similar (when it should be)
